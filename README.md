COVID-19 Global Impact Analysis
This project presents an end-to-end exploratory analysis of COVID-19's global impact, integrating epidemiological data with socio-economic indicators such as GDP per capita and the World Happiness Index. 

Objective
To analyze the spread and severity of COVID-19 across different countries, and explore its relationship with economic and well-being indicators using statistical and visual analysis techniques.

Datasets Used
covid19_Confirmed_dataset.csv (time-series format)

covid19_deaths_dataset.csv (time-series format)

worldwide_happiness_report.csv

Key Analysis Performed
Grouped and aggregated COVID-19 data by country (excluding province-level noise)

Identified countries with maximum infection and death rates

Merged infection and death data with economic and happiness indicators

Conducted correlation and comparative analysis between:

GDP per capita and infection/death rates

Happiness index and pandemic outcomes

Built insightful visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib

Visualizations
Line plots of top countries by confirmed cases

Scatter plots of GDP vs infection rates
Scatter plots of Social support vs infection rates
Scatter plots of Healthy life expectancy vs infection rates
